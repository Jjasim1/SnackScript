A programming language project for CMSI 3802

## Introduction
Long ago, a mother and her child were traveling multiple days across the cold, icy plains in search of finding safety from a terrible war. Suddenly, the mother had collapsed - putting both in a terrible situation. Far from any sort of civilization, there seemed to be no hope. Fate did not abandon them though; a wizard had found them and started casting his scripts. After teleporting them all to a warm house, the wizard used magic to create a warm meal for both. Before leaving them behind, he left the child with the magic stones that were used to help them out. Years later, the child had grown up and harnessed the magic within to make sure that no one was left hungry. With SnackScript, wizards and chefs alike can now write code in the form of recipes and use magic to compile them to make whatever they wish for.
